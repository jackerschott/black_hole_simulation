# orbs -- Optical Real-time Black hole Simulation

## Introduction
> This is a work in progress. Use at your own risk.

orbs will be a hardware-accelerated cross-platform simulation of black holes in
real-time.
If the latter is even possible depents on the physical effects
included in the simulation though.
The optical effects of a black hole which are simulated will be made visible
through particle clusters and a firmament rendered for a virtual observer while
respecting the relativistic effects of the black-hole on light.
The shape of these clusters will be manipulatable by the user and is filled
randomly by particles, while the firmament is rendered from a spherical texture
map.

## Features
* Rendering of particle clusters
* Available rendering effects
    * Non-retarded light-deflection
* Pointer/Mouse governed observer-control

## Future Features
* Rendering of firmament textures
* Rendering effects
    * Red/Blue-shift
    * Retarded light-deflection
* Dynamic effects
    * gravitational particle dynamics
    * gravitational observer dynamics
* Keyboard governed observer-control
